		<p># Applying CSS to html & Selectors in CSS
		### How do we apply CSS to html?
		- We can do it in three ways: first way is to link a external style sheet using tag, second way is to add a tag in element and last way is to add style="" attribute to an element.
		- All of the ways work but one should always prefer external style sheet and keep html file just for html (and write clean and readable code).

		## NOTE: You can validate CSS without ChatGPT, using "CSS validate service" website.
